						transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
						for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
						The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
						the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

				<h1 class="title title-dark">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>

				<p class="text text-dark">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
				professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
				student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
				did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
				project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
				could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
				experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
				100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
